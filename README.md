# AI Hospital Contextual Map

## Overview

This project provides a visual map of hospitals across the United States using data from the American Hospital Association (AHA) IT Supplement. The map presents hospital locations along with contextual information that can help researchers understand regional variation in digital health capacity, infrastructure, and system readiness.
## Purpose of the Map

Hospitals operate in very different settings. Some are in urban areas with strong digital infrastructure, while others serve rural communities with fewer resources. These differences impact how clinical AI tools can be implemented, scaled, and evaluated.

This map is designed to:

- Show where hospitals are located across the United States
- Highlight regional patterns related to infrastructure and context
- Illustrate variation that may influence digital health and AI adoption
- Support work in health equity, implementation science, and informatics research

## What the Notebook Includes

The notebook US_IT_hospital_map.ipynb walks through how to create the contextual map. It includes:

- Importing and preparing hospital location data
- Cleaning and organizing the data
- Building an interactive hospital map
- Overlaying contextual features such as geography or surrounding characteristics
- Demonstrating how visual mapping supports system-level analysis

## Project Status

The current version includes the 2023 AHA IT data.
The 2024 data will be added soon.
We will also upload an instructional walkthrough video demonstrating how to generate the map and customize layers.
Additional examples will show how users can overlay different contextual datasets depending on their research needs.

## Disclaimer

This map requires access to AHA proprietary data. Users must have appropriate permission or licensing to access and use the AHA data inputs. The repository does not share or redistribute any proprietary datasets.

## How This Can Be Used

The mapping workflow can support:

- Understanding regional variation in hospital digital infrastructure
- Identifying areas with limited technology capacity
- Evaluating readiness for AI and digital health tools
- Supporting health equity analyses through geographic context layers
